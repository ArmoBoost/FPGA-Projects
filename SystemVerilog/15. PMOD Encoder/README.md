# Encoder Pmod RBG Selector
The cores and drivers were created for the pmod to read the turning of the dial (L and R), pressing down of the dial, and the switch. This demo allows the user to select a color
(Red, Green, Or Blue) which is indicated by the right RGB LED on the board by pressing down the dial. The intensity of the color (ranging from 0 to 100) is determined by how much the dial is being turned. The SSEG displays show the intensity per color and the left RGB LED shows the final color depending on the user input. For example, if the user put R-100 , G-100, and B-100, we would get a white glow. R-100, G-0, B-50 would give us purple.
